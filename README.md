Day 1 - Introduction to Data Analytics and Python

Data Analytics is the process of collecting, organizing and studying data to find useful information understand what’s happening and make better decisions. In simple words it helps people and businesses learn from data like what worked in the past, what is happening now and what might happen in the future.

Process of Data Analytics

Data Collection : Data collection is the first step where raw information is gathered from different places like websites, apps, surveys or machines. Sometimes data comes from many sources and needs to be joined together. Other times only a small useful part of the data is selected.
Data Prepartion (Cleansing) : Once the data is collected it usually contains mistakes like wrong entries, missing values or repeated rows. In this step the data is cleaned to fix those problems and remove anything that isn’t needed. Clean data makes the results more accurate and trustworthy.
Data Analysis and Data Interpretation: After cleaning the data is studied using tools like Excel, Python, R or SQL. Analysts look for patterns, trends or useful information that can help solve problems or answer questions. The goal here is to understand what the data is telling us.
Data Visualization: Data visualization is the process of creating visual representation of data using the plots, charts and graphs which helps to analyze the patterns, trends and get the valuable insights of the data. By comparing the datasets and analyzing it data analysts find the useful data from the raw data.

Types of Data Analytics

Descriptive Data Analytics : Descriptive data analytics helps to summarize and understand past data. It shows what has happened by using tables, charts and averages. Companies use it to compare results, find strengths and weaknesses and spot any unusual patterns.
Diagnostic Data Analytics: Diagnostic data analytics looks at why something happened in the past. It uses tools like correlation, regression or comparison to find the cause of a problem. This helps companies understand the reason behind a drop in sales or a sudden change in performance.
Predictive Data Analytics: Predictive data analytics is used to guess what might happen in the future. It looks at current and past data to find patterns and make forecasts. Businesses use it to predict things like customer behavior, future sales or possible risks.
Prescriptive Data Analytics: Prescriptive data analytics helps to choose the best action or solution. It looks at different options and suggests what should be done next. Companies use it for things like loan approval, pricing decisions and managing machines or schedules.
